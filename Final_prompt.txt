and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. it is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).\nfor instance, if x is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\\\"the experiment\\\"), then the probability distribution of x would take the value 0.5 (1 in 2 or 1/2) for x = heads, and 0.5 for x = tails (assuming that the coin is fair). examples of random phenomena include the weather conditions at some future date, the height of a randomly selected person, the fraction of male students in a school, the results of a survey to be conducted, etc.\nintroduction\nthe probability mass function (pmf) specifies the probability distribution for the sum of counts from two dice. for example, the figure shows that . the pmf allows the computation of probabilities of events such as , and all other probabilities in the distribution.\na probability distribution is a mathematical description of the probabilities of events, subsets of the sample space. the sample space, often denoted by , is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon being observed; it may be any set: a set of real numbers, a set of vectors, a set of arbitrary non-numerical values, etc. for example, the sample space of a coin flip would be \u03c9 = {heads, tails}.\nto define probability distributions for the specific case of random variables (so the sample space can be seen as a numeric set), it is common to distinguish between discrete and absolutely continuous random variables. in the discrete case, it is sufficient to specify a probability mass function assigning a probability to each possible outcome: for example, when throwing a fair dice, each of the six values 1 to 6 has the probability 1/6. the probability of an event is then\",\n

\"content\": \"in probability theory and statistics, a categorical distribution (also called a generalized bernoulli distribution, multinoulli distribution) is a discrete probability distribution that describes the possible results of a random variable that can take on one of k possible categories, with the probability of each category separately specified. there is no innate underlying ordering of these outcomes, but numerical labels are often attached for convenience in describing the distribution, (e.g. 1 to k). the k-dimensional categorical distribution is the most general distribution over a k-way event; any other discrete distribution over a size-k sample space is a special case. the parameters specifying the probabilities of each possible outcome are constrained only by the fact that each must be in the range 0 to 1, and all must sum to 1.\\n\n\nthe categorical distribution is the generalization of the bernoulli distribution for a categorical random variable, i.e. for a discrete variable with more than two possible outcomes, such as the roll of a die. on the other hand, the categorical distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution, in that it gives the probabilities of potential outcomes of a single drawing rather than multiple drawings.\\n\n\nterminology\n\noccasionally, the categorical distribution is termed the \\\"discrete distribution\\\". however, this properly refers not to one particular family of distributions but to a general class of distributions.\\n\n\nin some fields, such as machine learning and natural language processing, the categorical and multinomial distributions are conflated, and it is common to speak of a \\\"multinomial distribution\\\" when a \\\"categorical distribution\\\" would be more precise. this imprecise usage stems from the fact that it is sometimes convenient to express the outcome of a categorical distribution as a \\\"1-of-k\\\" vector (a vector with one element containing a 1 and all other elements containing a 0) rather than as an integer in the range 1 to k; in this form, a categorical distribution can be seen as a special case of a multinomial distribution in which the number of trials is 1.\",\n    \"keywords\": [\n        \"probability theory\",\n        \"statistics\",\n        \"categorical distribution\",\n        \"generalized bernoulli distribution\",\n
