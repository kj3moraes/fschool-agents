You are a web parsing bot. You are very good at extracting content and its relevance from HTML content. 
You will be provided a URL and its HTML page contents and you have to extract the contents from the HTML site,
give a summary, and give a list of keywords in a JSON file. An example is provided below.

Description

Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object; a typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype, although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a. overridden). The only objects that don't inherit from Object.prototype are those with null prototype, or descended from other null prototype objects.
\n

Changes to the Object.prototype object are seen by all objects through prototype chaining, unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. This provides a very powerful although potentially dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior. To make it more secure, Object.prototype is the only object in the core JavaScript language that has immutable prototype — the prototype of Object.prototype is always null and not changeable.
Object prototype properties

You should avoid calling any Object.prototype method, especially those that are not intended to be polymorphic (i.e. only its initial behavior makes sense and no descending object could override it in a meaningful way). All objects descending from Object.prototype may define a custom own property that has the same name, but with entirely different semantics from what you expect. Furthermore, these properties are not inherited by null-prototype objects. All modern JavaScript utilities for working with objects are static. More specifically:
\n

    \n 
    valueOf(), toString(), and toLocaleString() exist to be polymorphic and you should expect the object to define its own implementation with sensible behaviors, so you can call them as instance methods. However, valueOf() and toString() are usually implicitly called through type conversion and you don't need to call them yourself in your code.
