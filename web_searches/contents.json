The Fourth Edition provides a rigorous, yet clear and accessible treatment of the fundamentals of electromagnetic theory and offers a sound platform for explorations of related applications (AC circuits, antennas, transmission lines, plasmas, optics and more). Written keeping in mind the conceptual hurdles typically faced by undergraduate students, this textbook illustrates the theoretical steps with well-chosen examples and careful illustrations. It balances text and equations, allowing the physics to shine through without compromising the rigour of the math, and includes numerous problems, varying from straightforward to elaborate, so that students can be assigned some problems to build their confidence and others to stretch their minds. A Solutions Manual is available to instructors teaching from the book; access can be requested from the resources section at <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/electrodynamics.\">www.cambridge.org/electrodynamics.</a></p><figure></figure><p>Let\u2019s be real: 2020 has been a nightmare. Between the political unrest and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it\u2019s difficult to look back on the year and find something, anything, that was a potential bright spot in an otherwise turbulent trip around the sun. Luckily, there were a few bright spots: namely, some of the excellent works of military history and analysis, fiction and non-fiction, novels and graphic novels that we\u2019ve absorbed over the last year.</p><p>Here\u2019s a brief list of some of the best books we read here at Task &amp; Purpose in the last year.

The former executive asked not to be named due to a confidentiality agreement and fear of retribution by West. According to the agreement, West denied the executive\u2019s allegations.\n </p>\n <p>\n The executive told CNN that West spoke openly about reading \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Hitler\u2019s 1925 autobiographical manifesto and expressed his \u201cadmiration\u201d for the Nazis and Hitler for their use of propaganda. \n </p>\n <p>\n This individual stated that people in West\u2019s inner circle were \u201cfully aware\u201d of his interest in Hitler. Four sources told CNN that West had originally suggested the title \u201cHitler\u201d for his 2018 album that eventually released as \u201cYe.\u201d They did not want to be named, citing concern for professional retribution.\n </p>\n <p>\n CNN has reached out to West for comment. \n </p>\n <p>\n Universal Music Group, owner of Def Jam, which used to distribute West\u2019s music, said in a statement to CNN Tuesday that the company\u2019s relationship with his GOOD Music label ended last year. \n </p>\n <p>\n \u201cThere is no place for antisemitism in our society. We are deeply committed to combating antisemitism and every other form of prejudice,\u201d Universal Music group added.\n </p>\n <p>\n The sources CNN spoke with did not have information about why the album was ultimately called \u201cYe.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n Van Lathan Jr., a former TMZ employee, who confronted West during his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/entertainment/kanye-west-slavery-choice-trnd\">2018 interview </a>at their offices in which West said slavery \u201csounds like a choice,\u201d recently claimed on a podcast that West also made antisemitic comments during their conversation that the outlet did not release publicly. That\u2019s why Lathan said his current comments didn\u2019t surprise him.\n </p>\n <p>\n \u201cI already heard him say that stuff before at TMZ,\u201d Lathan said during an episode of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL_HWSByio&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\u201cHigher Learning\u201d podcast</a> earlier this month. \u201cI mean, I was taken aback because that type of antisemitic talk is disgusting. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m taken aback any time anyone does that, right? But as far as [West], I knew that that was in him because when he came to TMZ, he said that stuff and they took it out of the interview. \u2026 He said something like, \u2018I love Hitler, I love Nazis.\u2019 Something to that effect when he was there. And they took it out of the interview for whatever reason. It wasn\u2019t my decision.\u201d\n </p>\n<div>\n \n \n </div>\n <p>\n One of the sources who spoke to CNN and was at the TMZ interview said West had favorably referenced Hitler.\n </p>\n <p>\n CNN has reached out to TMZ for comment.\n </p>\n <p>\n The revelation of West\u2019s alleged history of admiring Hitler comes amid a wave of inflammatory actions by West that began earlier this month.

E-scooters and e-bikes are thought to substitute active modes of transport (for example, distances 0\u20135 miles) that include both commuting and recreational use<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41560-022-01135-1#ref-CR5\">5</a>,<a href=\"/articles/s41560-022-01135-1#ref-CR6\">6</a></sup>, but evidence that micromobility adoption can ease traffic congestion or provide sustainability benefits through substitution of travel modes has been controversial<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41560-022-01135-1#ref-CR7\">7</a></sup>. Many cities have banned micromobility devices citing personal safety or other concerns, while other cities have allowed its proliferation largely without changes in urban infrastructure needed for widespread adoption. A fundamental challenge to learn whether micromobility is a complement or a substitute for vehicle choice is largely behavioural.</p><p>Causal evidence of the impacts of micromobility on urban sustainability outcomes has, to date, been relatively weak, relying on self-reported usage data from survey questionnaires, which is subject to hypothetical, hindsight or recency bias. Other evidence on travel mode choice has typically relied on simulations from smaller datasets, which present modelling challenges related to population sampling and endogeneity concerns.

Or perhaps you\u2019ve struggled to fall asleep as your brain cycles endlessly through intrusive thoughts? Do you ever get \u201cin the zone\u201d while deeply engaged in an activity, like playing music or sports?</p><p>These are some of the common experiences that have inspired a team of scientists to dramatically reimagine the evolution of consciousness, which is a state of awareness that humans (and perhaps some other animals) possess about their minds and the world. Led by Andrew Budson, a professor of neurology at Boston University and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School, the researches propose that \u201cconsciousness is, at its core, a memory system,\u201d and that other functions that we associate with consciousness like problem-solving \u201cdeveloped later in evolutionary history,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/cogbehavneurol/Fulltext/9900/Consciousness_as_a_Memory_System.19.aspx\">a study published this month</a> in the journal <em>Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology</em>.</p><p>One important consequence of this hypothesis is that all of our decisions and actions are actually performed unconsciously, and then remembered consciously about a half-second later. In this way, our brains fool us into thinking we are making conscious actions in the present, when we are only experiencing delayed memories of events. In fact, what we call consciousness was initially developed to facilitate episodic memory\u2014the brain combining sensory inputs to form a recollection of events\u2014according to the theory.\u00a0</p><p>For Budson, this new way of thinking about consciousness is informed by his longtime fascination with the science of memory, his clinical experience with patients that have memory disorders, and his personal life as the father of a son with Kanner autism, which affects the ability to form some types of memories.\u00a0</p><p>All of these threads came together into the novel framework over the past few years, spurred on by conversations with his two co-authors on the study: Kenneth Richman, a philosopher and bioethicist at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and Elizabeth Kensinger, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Boston College.</p><p>\u201cOnce I had the insight that consciousness is part of memory, then the anatomy of consciousness\u2014the neural correlates of consciousness\u2014immediately falls out, because I know the neural correlates of memory,\u201d Budson said in a call with Motherboard. \u201cFrom all my patient experience, I saw how this fit in so well. It's really a separate insight, but I view it all as falling out of the same central one, which is that there's no single area of the cortex that is conscious.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, Budson and his colleagues suggest that the origins of consciousness in memory\u2014and its continued existence across the brain\u2019s memory system\u2014explains all sorts of phenomena. For example, they note that athletes take split-second actions unconsciously first, with the conscious awareness (or memory) of those actions only arriving later.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOur theory of consciousness rejects the idea that consciousness initially evolved in order to allow us to make sense of the world and act accordingly, and then, at some later point, episodic memory developed to store such conscious representations,\u201d Budson and his colleagues said in the study. \u201cOur theory is that consciousness developed with the evolution of episodic memory simply\u2014and powerfully\u2014to enable the phenomena of remembering.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe posit further that consciousness was subsequently co-opted to produce other functions that are not directly relevant to memory per se, such as problem-solving, abstract thinking, and language,\u201d the team noted. \u201cWe suggest that this theory is compatible with many phenomena, such as the slow speed and the after-the-fact order of consciousness, that cannot be explained well by other theories. We believe that our theory may have profound implications for understanding intentional action and consciousness in general.\u201d\u00a0</p><p"

The former executive asked not to be named due to a confidentiality agreement and fear of retribution by West. According to the agreement, West denied the executive\u2019s allegations.\n </p>\n <p>\n The executive told CNN that West spoke openly about reading \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Hitler\u2019s 1925 autobiographical manifesto and expressed his \u201cadmiration\u201d for the Nazis and Hitler for their use of propaganda. \n </p>\n <p>\n This individual stated that people in West\u2019s inner circle were \u201cfully aware\u201d of his interest in Hitler.

That\u2019s why Lathan said his current comments didn\u2019t surprise him.\n </p>\n <p>\n \u201cI already heard him say that stuff before at TMZ,\u201d Lathan said during an episode of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL_HWSByio&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\u201cHigher Learning\u201d podcast</a> earlier this month. \u201cI mean, I was taken aback because that type of antisemitic talk is disgusting. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m taken aback any time anyone does that, right? But as far as [West], I knew that that was in him because when he came to TMZ, he said that stuff and they took it out of the interview. \u2026 He said something like, \u2018I love Hitler, I love Nazis.\u2019 Something to that effect when he was there.

Led by Andrew Budson, a professor of neurology at Boston University and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School, the researches propose that \u201cconsciousness is, at its core, a memory system,\u201d and that other functions that we associate with consciousness like problem-solving \u201cdeveloped later in evolutionary history,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/cogbehavneurol/Fulltext/9900/Consciousness_as_a_Memory_System.19.aspx\">a study published this month</a> in the journal <em>Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology</em>.</p><p>One important consequence of this hypothesis is that all of our decisions and actions are actually performed unconsciously, and then remembered consciously about a half-second later. In this way, our brains fool us into thinking we are making conscious actions in the present, when we are only experiencing delayed memories of events. In fact, what we call consciousness was initially developed to facilitate episodic memory\u2014the brain combining sensory inputs to form a recollection of events\u2014according to the theory.\u00a0</p><p>For Budson, this new way of thinking about consciousness is informed by his longtime fascination with the science of memory, his clinical experience with patients that have memory disorders, and his personal life as the father of a son with Kanner autism, which affects the ability to form some types of memories.\u00a0</p><p>All of these threads came together into the novel framework over the past few years, spurred on by conversations with his two co-authors on the study: Kenneth Richman, a philosopher and bioethicist at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and Elizabeth Kensinger, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Boston College.</p><p>\u201cOnce I had the insight that consciousness is part of memory, then the anatomy of consciousness\u2014the neural correlates of consciousness\u2014immediately falls out, because I know the neural correlates of memory,\u201d Budson said in a call with Motherboard. \u201cFrom all my patient experience, I saw how this fit in so well. It's really a separate insight, but I view it all as falling out of the same central one, which is that there's no single area of the cortex that is conscious.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, Budson and his colleagues suggest that the origins of consciousness in memory\u2014and its continued existence across the brain\u2019s memory system\u2014explains all sorts of phenomena. For example, they note that athletes take split-second actions unconsciously first, with the conscious awareness (or memory) of those actions only arriving later.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOur theory of consciousness rejects the idea that consciousness initially evolved in order to allow us to make sense of the world and act accordingly, and then, at some later point, episodic memory developed to store such conscious representations,\u201d Budson and his colleagues said in the study. \u201cOur theory is that consciousness developed with the evolution of episodic memory simply\u2014and powerfully\u2014to enable the phenomena of remembering.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe posit further that consciousness was subsequently co-opted to produce other functions that are not directly relevant to memory per se, such as problem-solving, abstract thinking, and language,\u201d the team noted. \u201cWe suggest that this theory is compatible with many phenomena, such as the slow speed and the after-the-fact order of consciousness, that cannot be explained well by other theories. We believe that our theory may have profound implications for understanding intentional action and consciousness in general.\u201d\u00a0</p><p"
