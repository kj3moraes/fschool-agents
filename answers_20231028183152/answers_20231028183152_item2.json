{"answers": [{"section": "a", "question": "Explain the basics of a fractal model.", "answer": "A fractal model is a mathematical construct that is self-similar, meaning it appears the same at any scale. Fractals are complex shapes made up of an infinite number of similar, smaller copies of the whole, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. They are often used to model structures in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth, fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation."}, {"section": "b", "question": "How could you apply this model to understand the structure of Chromatin?", "answer": "The fractal model can be applied to understand the structure of Chromatin by considering the self-similar nature of fractals. Chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein, has a hierarchical structure that can be considered self-similar at different scales. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which repeats along the DNA molecule. Higher levels of organization involve the packing of these nucleosomes into more compact structures, and this packing can also be considered to repeat in a self-similar manner. Therefore, a fractal model could potentially capture this complex, multi-scale organization."}]}
