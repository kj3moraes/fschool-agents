{"answers": [{"section": "a", "question": "Define kurtosis in statistical terms.", "answer": "Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a probability distribution. Specifically, it measures the 'tailedness' and sharpness of the peak of a distribution. A high kurtosis indicates a distribution with heavy tails and a sharp peak, while a low kurtosis indicates a distribution with light tails and a flat peak. The standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3."}, {"section": "b", "question": "How does the kurtosis of a Laplace distribution differ from that of a normal distribution?", "answer": "The kurtosis of a Laplace distribution is higher than that of a normal distribution. This means that a Laplace distribution has heavier tails and a sharper peak than a normal distribution. Specifically, the kurtosis of a Laplace distribution is 6, while the kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3. This indicates that extreme values are more likely in a Laplace distribution than in a normal distribution."}]}
