{"answers": [{"section": "a", "question": "Derive the mean and variance for a binomial distribution.", "answer": "The mean (\u03bc) and variance (\u03c3^2) of a binomial distribution can be derived from its parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success on each trial (p). The mean of a binomial distribution is calculated as the product of the number of trials and the probability of success, \u03bc = np. The variance is calculated as the product of the number of trials, the probability of success, and the probability of failure (1-p), \u03c3^2 = np(1-p)."}, {"section": "b", "question": "How do these values change when the distribution is skewed?", "answer": "In a binomial distribution, skewness is determined by the probability of success (p). If p > 0.5, the distribution is negatively skewed, and if p < 0.5, it is positively skewed. The mean shifts towards the tail of the distribution, but the variance remains the same as it depends on both p and (1-p). However, the distribution becomes less dispersed (i.e., the variance decreases) as the distribution becomes more skewed, because the outcomes become more predictable."}]}
