    "The Chi-squared distribution in probability theory and statistics is the distribution of a sum of the squares of independent standard normal random variables. It is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in the construction of confidence intervals. \n\nThe Chi-squared distribution is used in the common Chi-squared tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one, the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data, and in confidence interval estimation for a population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation. \n\nThe Chi-squared distribution has one parameter, a positive integer $k$ that specifies the number of degrees of freedom (the number of random variables being summed). If $Z_1, ..., Z_k$ are independent, standard normal random variables, then the sum of their squares,\n\n$$Q = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + ... + Z_k^2$$\n\nis distributed according to the Chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom. This distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing, and to a lesser extent for confidence intervals for population variance when the underlying distribution is normal."
